# Csharp
A very lame game I made that tests your basic arithmetic.
features include:
    -timer
    -difficulty settings
    -highsocre saving w/ json

bugs I found:
    -qns will reset if you press enter or a character without timer resetting. timer will continue in the background and collapse when it finishes
    -game is lame
    -no implementation of difficulty matching to highscore json

features to implement:
    -rougelike elements
        -boons and curses
        -maybe a boon will be no multiplications for 3 turns
        -a curse could be disabling the easy multiplication thing for 3 turns
